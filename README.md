# Task 3: SQL for Data Analysis

##  Objective
Use SQL queries to extract, manipulate, and analyze data from the Brazilian Ecommerce dataset.

##  What I Did

- Created tables and set foreign key constraints.
- Executed SQL queries to analyze the data using:
  - `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`
  - Joins (`INNER`, `LEFT`)
  - Subqueries
  - Aggregate functions (`SUM`, `AVG`)
  - Views
  - Indexes (for performance)
